# MFCViews
Creating and working with graphic interface via dialog window (Visual Studio)

It is not the whole project, the rest of files are extremely large. To show the functions of the application, '.exe' was added. Other files are to provide the logics of the app. 

Originally, you see a sine function graph; 

  with mouse moved you can shift throghout it, 
  with mouse scrolled you will observe the changes in sine's period, 
  with mouse scrolled and "ctrl" pushed the amplitude changes. 
  
Also, there are presented different types of menus, modal and non-modal dialogs as well.
